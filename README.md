Library Automation is a program that helps manage a library's resources, created using C# and Windows Forms. 
It lets people sign up from the application, and members can see what books are available and borrow them. 
Administrators can do more things like adding or removing members and books, and can also see who has borrowed a book and when it's due back. 
In short, it's a user-friendly program that makes managing a library much easier.

NOTE: The goal of this project is to test my C# and SQL knowledge, it's not an actual project with expectings.
